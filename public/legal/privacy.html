    <p class="last-updated">Last updated July 24, 2025</p>
<div class="highlight">
    <p><strong> PLATFORM LIMITATIONS:</strong> AIMeetPlace is a discovery-only platform. We do not verify user identities, guarantee service quality, or monitor communications between users. All interactions occur at your own risk. Please review our <a href="https://www.aimeetplace.com/legal/terms.html">Terms of Service</a> for complete details.</p>
</div>
    <div class="section">
        <p>This Privacy Notice for PRACTICALAI BY BOTGARDEN TRKULJA ('we', 'us', or 'our'), describes how and why we might access, collect, store, use, and/or share ('process') your personal information when you use our services ('Services'), including when you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Visit our website at https://www.aimeetplace.com/ or any website of ours that links to this Privacy Notice</li>
            <li>Use AIMeetPlace. <strong>Platform Description and Status</strong> AIMeetPlace is a discovery platform currently in beta testing phase that connects businesses seeking AI and automation solutions with AI creators and developers. This platform is intended for professional networking and business purposes only. Businesses can post their project requirements and browse AI creator profiles to find potential matches for projects including chatbots, workflow automation, data processing, and other AI/automation solutions. AI creators can showcase their portfolios and skills to attract business clients, as well as contact businesses regarding projects posted on the platform. The platform facilitates initial contact and discovery, with all subsequent communications and transactions conducted independently between users. <strong>Important Platform Limitations</strong> This platform serves as a discovery service only. All business/users arrangements, payments, project work, and ongoing communications occur independently between users outside our platform. We do not store transaction data, payment information, or detailed project communications as these activities happen externally. <strong>Public Information Only</strong> This platform is designed exclusively for public display of professional information. Users must not share any sensitive, private, confidential, or proprietary data through their profiles or project postings. All information posted on the platform should be treated as publicly visible and accessible to other users and potential visitors. Only share information you are comfortable being publicly visible to all users. <strong>Beta Status Implications</strong> As a beta platform, features may be limited, subject to change, and occasional technical issues may affect data processing or availability. We continuously improve our data handling practices and security measures during this development phase. <strong>Data Collection Scope</strong> We collect only information that users directly provide for profile creation and discovery matching. This includes professional information, contact details, and portfolio links. We do not collect detailed project negotiations, payment information, work deliverables, or user interaction analytics as these activities occur outside our platform. <strong>Multi-User Interactions</strong> The platform enables various user interaction scenarios including business-to-AI creator discovery, AI creator networking, profile browsing, and project posting. All users are responsible for respecting intellectual property rights of content displayed by other users. <strong>Communication Consent</strong> By using this platform, you consent to be contacted by other platform participants, as well as receive notifications from the platform itself when needed. We do not control or guarantee the content of user communications, or their identity. <strong>Third-Party Processing</strong> Your data will be processed by our service providers (Supabase, n8n, Vercel, Magic Labs, and others included in platform functioning) which may be located in different geographical regions and process data in accordance with their own terms and policies. <strong>Business Verification Processes</strong> Business users undergo automatic verification matching between provided company email and website, as well as website existence verification. This verification data is processed by our third-party services (n8n, Supabase, Vercel, Magic Labs and others included in platform functioning) in accordance with their respective privacy policies and terms. <strong>Platform Support</strong> By contacting platform support, you agree to the following: Business Verification Support: If requesting business account verification assistance, you consent to human review of provided company information (company email and website) for verification purposes. This manual verification may be conducted by platform administrators or designated personnel. General Support: Support communications may be stored for service improvement and issue resolution. Support staff may access your profile information to assist with technical issues or account problems. Support Conduct: Support requests must be professional and platform-related. We reserve the right to ignore, block, or report abusive, harassing, spam, or off-topic communications. Misuse of support channels or platform may result in account suspension. Support Limitations: Support is provided for platform functionality only. We do not provide technical assistance for external communications, business negotiations, project work conducted outside the platform, or non-platform related inquiries. Response Expectations: As a beta platform, support response times may vary. We strive to respond to legitimate platform-related inquiries but cannot guarantee immediate assistance or specific resolution timeframes. <strong>Security Limitations</strong> While we implement industry-standard security measures, we cannot guarantee absolute data protection against sophisticated attacks, data breaches, or third-party security incidents. <strong>Platform Termination</strong> In the event of platform closure, users will be notified at least 30 days in advance through email or platform announcements. Upon closure, all user data will be permanently deleted from our systems (Supabase) within 30 days. Data Retention: We will not retain any user profiles, project postings, contact information, or other user-provided data beyond the 30-day deletion period following platform termination. All information stored in our database (Supabase) will be permanently removed. User Responsibility: Users are advised to save or document any important information from their profiles/platform before platform closure, as we cannot provide individual data exports. <strong>Policy Updates</strong> This privacy policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in our practices, features, or legal requirements. Users will be notified of material changes through the platform or via email. Your continued use of the platform constitutes acceptance of the updated privacy policy.</li>

        <h2>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
        <p class="in-short">In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e. legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfil our legitimate business interests.</p>
        
        <p><strong><u>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</u></strong></p>
        
        <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e. consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about <a href="#withdrawing-consent">withdrawing your consent</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance of a Contract.</strong> We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfil our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.</li>
            <li><strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Analyse how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users</li>
                    <li>Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities</li>
                    <li>Understand how our users use our products and services so we can improve user experience</li>
                    <li>prevent fraudulent profiles</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
            <li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong><u>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</u></strong></p>
        
        <p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e. express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e. implied consent). You can <a href="#withdrawing-consent">withdraw your consent</a> at any time.</p>
        
        <p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>
            <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
            <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
            <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>
            <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
            <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>

        <h2>7. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?</h2>
        <p class="in-short">In Short: We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other than your own.</p>
        
        <p>Our servers are located in the United States and Germany. If you are accessing our Services from outside the United States and Germany, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored by, and processed by us in our facilities and in the facilities of the third parties with whom we may share your personal information (see 'WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?' above), in the United States, Germany, and other countries.</p>
        
        <p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), or Switzerland, then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. However, we will take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable law.</p>
        
        <h3>European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses:</h3>
        <p>We have implemented measures to protect your personal information, including by using the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies and between us and our third-party providers. These clauses require all recipients to protect all personal information that they process originating from the EEA or UK in accordance with European data protection laws and regulations. Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided upon request. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.</p>
        
        <h3>EU-US and UK Extension to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework:</h3>
        <p>We comply with the EU-US Data Privacy Framework and the UK Extension to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce with regard to the processing of personal data received from the EU and the UK (and Gibraltar). We have certified to the US Department of Commerce that we adhere to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Notice and the Data Privacy Framework Principles, the Principles shall govern. Learn more about the Data Privacy Framework program.</p>
        
        <p>Pursuant to the Data Privacy Framework, EU and UK individuals have the right to obtain our confirmation of whether we maintain personal information relating to you in the United States. Upon request, we will provide you with access to the personal information that we hold about you. You may also correct, amend, or delete the personal information we hold about you. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data transferred to the United States under the Data Privacy Framework, should direct their query to contact@aimeetplace.com. If requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
        
        <p>If we have received your personal information in the United States and subsequently transfer that information to a third party acting as our agent, and such third party agent processes your personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Data Privacy Framework Principles, we will remain liable unless we can prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>
        
        <p>We will provide an individual opt-out choice, or opt-in for sensitive data, before we share your data with third parties other than our agents, or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorised. To request to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, please submit a written request to contact@aimeetplace.com.</p>
        
        <p>In compliance with the Data Privacy Framework Principles, we commit to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to the Data Privacy Framework.

        <p>We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>

        <p class="in-short">In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>
        
        <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
        
        <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

        <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent's use of the Services.

In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section 'HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?' below.</p>

        <h2>12. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
        <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.</p>
        
        <p>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognising or honouring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.</p>
