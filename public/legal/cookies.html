    <h1>COOKIE POLICY</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated August 8, 2025</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p>This Cookie Policy explains how AIMeetPlace ("<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>us</strong>," and "<strong>our</strong>") uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our website at <a href="https://www.aimeetplace.com/" target="_blank">https://www.aimeetplace.com/</a> ("<strong>Website</strong>"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What are cookies and similar technologies?</h2>
        <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently.</p>
        
        <p>We also use similar technologies like localStorage and sessionStorage, which function similarly to cookies but are stored differently in your browser. Throughout this policy, we refer to all these technologies collectively as "cookies".</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What cookies and similar technologies do we use?</h2>
        <p>We currently use only <strong>essential cookies</strong> that are strictly necessary for our Website to function properly. These cookies cannot be disabled as they are required for basic site functionality.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> We use localStorage and sessionStorage technologies which function similarly to cookies. While these are not traditional cookies, they serve the same purpose and are covered by this policy.</p>
        
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Cookie Type</th>

            <tr>
                <td>Authentication Storage (localStorage)</td>
                <td>Stores authentication tokens to keep you logged in securely</td>

                <td>Magic Link Session</td>
                <td>Manages the secure login process via email links</td>
                <td>Session (expires when browser closes)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cookie Consent (localStorage)</td>
                <td>Remembers that you've been informed about our cookie usage</td>

        </table>
        
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> We do NOT currently use any analytics, advertising, or tracking cookies. All data storage is essential for the Website's operation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Legal basis for using cookies</h2>
        <p>Under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and ePrivacy Directive, we use essential cookies based on our <strong>legitimate interest</strong> in providing you with a functional website. These cookies are strictly necessary for the operation of our service and do not require your consent, though we inform you about their use through this policy and our cookie banner.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Your Rights:</strong> Under GDPR, you have the right to:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>Lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>How can I control cookies?</h2>
        <p>Since we only use essential cookies that are necessary for the Website to function, you cannot disable them while using our service. However, you can delete all cookies and localStorage data through your browser settings, though this will log you out and reset your preferences.</p>

        <h2>Updates to this Cookie Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for legal, operational, or regulatory reasons. The date at the top of this policy indicates when it was last updated.</p>
        
        <p>This policy is reviewed at least annually. If we make significant changes, especially if we introduce new types of cookies, we will notify you through our Website.</p>
