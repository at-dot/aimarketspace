    <h1>TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated July 22, 2025</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>AGREEMENT TO OUR LEGAL TERMS</h2>
        <p>We are PRACTICALAI BY BOTGARDEN TRKULJA ('Company', 'we', 'us', or 'our'), a company registered in Norway at Oslo.</p>
        
        <p>We operate the website https://aimarketspace.vercel.app (the 'Site'), as well as any other related products and services that refer or link to these legal terms (the 'Legal Terms') (collectively, the 'Services').</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Users:</strong> All participants on platform</p>
            
            <p><strong>Platform Status:</strong> AIMarketSpace is currently in beta testing phase. Features may be limited, subject to change, and occasional technical issues may occur. You acknowledge this is a beta platform provided "as-is" with no warranties. Features may be removed without notice. We are not liable for any losses due to beta limitations.</p>
            
            <p>AIMarketSpace is a discovery platform that connects businesses seeking AI and automation solutions with AI creators and developers. Businesses can post their project requirements and browse AI creator profiles to find potential matches for projects including chatbots, workflow automation, data processing, and other AI/automation solutions. Posts are visible on the platform for 30 days. AI creators can showcase their portfolios and skills to attract business clients, as well as contact businesses regarding projects posted on the platform. The platform facilitates initial contact and discovery, with all subsequent communications and transactions conducted independently between users.</p>
            <p><strong>IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER - PLATFORM LIMITATIONS:</strong><br>
AIMarketSpace does NOT verify, endorse, or guarantee:<br>
- The identity, credentials, or legitimacy of any user (AI creators or businesses)<br>
- The quality, legality, or successful delivery of any services or projects<br>
- The accuracy of information in profiles, portfolios, or project posts<br>
- The outcomes of any connections, communications, or collaborations made through the platform<br>
- That business verification confirms actual legal entity status or authorization<br>
<br>
ALL USERS INTERACT AT THEIR OWN RISK. You are solely responsible for conducting your own due diligence, verification, and assessment of any user before entering into agreements or sharing information. The platform serves ONLY as a discovery tool - all arrangements, communications, and transactions occur independently between users outside our control.</p>
            <p><strong>PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY:</strong> The platform does not carry professional liability insurance for work performed by AI creators or projects posted by businesses. Users should ensure their counterparts have appropriate insurance or accept all risks associated with engagements formed through the platform.</p>
            
            <p><strong>NO BACKGROUND CHECKS:</strong> We do not conduct criminal background checks, verify educational credentials, professional licenses, or validate any claims made in user profiles/business posts. All information is self-reported and unverified. This includes business verification through our platform as we cannot guarantee anyone's identity. Users must conduct their own due diligence and verification before engaging with other users.</p>
            
            <p><strong>RECOMMENDATIONS AND REFERRALS:</strong> We do not verify or endorse any recommendations, endorsements, or referrals between users. Any reliance on such information is at your own risk.</p>
            
            <p>We provide a platform for discovery only - all vetting, business arrangements, payments, and project delivery occur directly between users outside our platform. Users are responsible for verifying each others credentials and skills. Users agree to be contacted by other platform users and platform itself when needed. The platform does not guarantee work/communication quality, project outcomes, or user credentials.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Account Requirements:</strong> Users must maintain only one account using their real identity. Fake profiles or misrepresentation of identity is prohibited.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Business Verification:</strong> By agreeing to these terms, businesses accept to be verified in accordance with platform procedures, including automatic verification matching between company email and provided website, as well as website existence verification. Users agree that third parties (n8n, Supabase, vercel, magiclabs and other included in platform functioning) process information provided in accordance with their terms and practice. This automated verification does not guarantee the legitimacy, financial stability, or actual representation rights of the person registering on behalf of the business. All users must conduct their own due diligence.<br>
<br>
<strong>Verification Limitations:</strong> The automated business verification process is limited in scope and ONLY confirms that the email domain matches the provided website domain and that the website is accessible. It does NOT verify:<br>
- Whether the business is a legally registered entity<br>
- Whether the person registering has actual authority to represent the company<br>
- The business's financial status, creditworthiness, or operational standing<br>
- Professional licenses, permits, or regulatory compliance<br>
- Actual identity of the business or person registering (this applies to ALL users on the platform, including both businesses and AI creators)<br>
<br>
A "verified" status indicates only that these basic automated checks were passed. Users should not rely solely on this verification and must independently verify all business information before entering into any agreements or sharing sensitive information.</p>
            <p><strong>Content Ownership:</strong> You retain ownership of all content you post on the platform. By posting content, you grant AIMarketSpace a non-exclusive, worldwide license to display and distribute your content solely for platform operation. Please do not publish any private/sensitive data. AIMarketSpace is meant only for public display of information users provided. Users are responsible for respecting intellectual property rights of portfolio content displayed by other creators. AI creators must disclose if portfolio items were created with AI assistance and cannot claim sole authorship of AI-generated work.By displaying portfolios publicly, AI creators acknowledge the risk of idea/design copying. We are not responsible for intellectual property theft between users.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Prohibited Content and Conduct:</strong> Users must not post projects requiring NDAs or confidential information handling through the platform. AI creators must not misrepresent their technical capabilities, experience level, or guarantee specific outcomes. Automated data collection, scraping, or unauthorized API usage is strictly prohibited. Using the platform to recruit users for competing platforms is not allowed. We reserve the right to use automated content moderation which may result in false positives.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Financial Disclaimer:</strong> We NEVER handle payments between users. All financial arrangements, transactions, invoicing, and payment processing occur entirely outside our platform. We do not endorse any payment methods and are not responsible for non-payment, chargebacks, or financial disputes between users. Report suspicious payment requests to support.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Platform Data and Termination:</strong> Project posts automatically expire after 30 days. Deleted user data may remain in backups (Supabase) for up to 30 days. Upon platform closure, users will receive 30 days notice and all data will be permanently deleted within 30 days.. We may use anonymized usage statistics indefinitely for platform improvement.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Support and Disputes:</strong> Platform support covers only platform functionality issues. We do not mediate user disputes, provide technical assistance for work conducted outside the platform, or guarantee response times during beta. Support aims to respond within 5 business days but cannot guarantee.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Account Termination:</strong> Either party may terminate this agreement. We may suspend accounts for terms violations. Some obligations survive termination.</p>
            
            <p><strong>INACTIVE ACCOUNTS:</strong> Accounts with no login activity for 12+ months may be deleted without additional notice. Premium features (if any) do not extend this period.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Changes to Terms:</strong> We may modify these terms with advance notice. Continued use constitutes acceptance of updated terms.</p>
            
            <p><strong>User-to-User Disputes:</strong> For any disputes between users (AI creators and businesses), each party must pursue claims independently and directly with the other party. We do not mediate, arbitrate, or involve ourselves in disputes between users. By using this platform, users expressly waive any and all claims against AIMarketSpace arising from interactions, transactions, or disputes with other users. This includes but is not limited to claims related to work quality, non-payment, miscommunication, or unfulfilled agreements.</p>
            
            <p><strong>COMPLAINT DEADLINE:</strong> Any claims against the platform must be brought within one (1) year after the claim arises, or be forever barred.</p>
